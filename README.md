### Feature Branch Strategy
![img link is broken](https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1562127879155993571903-feature-branch-workflow.png)

In this workflow, you setup a new feature branch every time you want to develop a new feature. You can apply a hotfix at anytime on the master branch in case a problem arises. Developers will need to pull in the latest fixes from the master branch first before they can merge their feature branch into master. You will need a naming convention for your branches in order to track features and bug fixes that are currently under development.

***
Here are some of the format suggestions you can find on the internet:
1. users/username/description
1. users/username/workitem
1. bugfix/description
1. features/feature-name
1. features/feature-area/feature-name
1. features/id (the ‘id’ is generated by a project management tool)
1. hotfix/description
***
* Pros:
1. You can have large number of developers on your project working on multiple features concurrently
1. It’s easy to remove features and restore them later if you change your mind
1. You can easily track what each developer is working on
* Cons:
1. Developing features concurrently is not always feasible for situations where implementing a feature is dependent on another feature yet to be developed. This means the features can’t be pushed to the master until all dependent features are complete

# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.
